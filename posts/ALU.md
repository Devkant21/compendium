1. ALU consists of two units—arithmetic unit and logic unit.
    - The arithmetic unit performs arithmetic operations on the data that is made available to it.
2. Some of the arithmetic operations supported by the arithmetic unit are—addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
    - The logic unit of ALU is responsible for performing logic operations. Logic unit performs comparisons of numbers, letters and special characters. Logic operations include testing for greater than, less than or equal to condition.
    - ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations, and uses registers to hold the data that is being processed.
