- Direct access'

1. Sequential Access Devices
    - Sequential access means that computer must run through the data in sequence, starting from the beginning, in order to locate a particular piece of data. Magnetic tape is an example of sequential access device. Let us suppose that magnetic tape consists of 80 records. To access the 25th record, the computer starts from first record, then reaches second, third etc. until it reaches the 25th record. Sequential access devices are generally slow devices.

2. Direct Access Devices
    - Direct access devices are the ones in which any piece of data can be retrieved in a non-sequential manner by locating it using the dataâ€™s address. It accesses the data directly, from a desired location. Magnetic disks and optical disks are examples of direct access devices. There is no predefined order in which one can read and write data from a direct access device. In a magnetic disk consisting of 80 records, to access the 25th record, the computer can directly access the 25th record, without going past the first 24 records. Based on access, magnetic tapes are sequential access devices, and, magnetic disks, optical disk and magneto-optical disks are direct access devices.
