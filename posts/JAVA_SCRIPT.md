## **Variables and Data**

<h4>Just like we follow some rules while speaking english (the grammar), we have some rules to follow while writing a javascript program. The set to follow while writing a javascript program. The set of these rules is called syntax in javascript</h4>
<br>
<h2><b>What is a Variable? </b></h2>
<h4>A variable is a container that stores a value. This is very similar to the containers used to store rice,water and oats. (Treat this as a analogy!).
<br>
The value of a javasript variable can be changed during the execution of a program.
<br>
var a = 7; <br>
let a = 7; ---- Declaring variables
</h4>
<br>

<h1><b>Rules for choosing a variable name----> </b> </h1><br>
<h4><b>Letters,digits,underscores and $ sign are allowed. <br><br>
Must begin with a $,_or a letter. <br><br>
Javascript reserved words cannot be used as a variable name. <br><br>
Harry & harry are different variables (case sensitive).</b></h4>
<br><br><br>
<h1><b>Var vs Let in Java script </b></h1><br>
<h4><b>Var is globally scoped while let and const are block scoped. <br><br>
Var can be upated and re-decleared within its scope.<br><br>
Let can be updated but not re-decleared. <br><br>
Const can neither be updated nor be re-declared. <br><br>
Var variables are initialized with undefined whereas let and const varibles are not initialized.
<br><br>
Const must be initialized during declearation unlike let and var.</b></h4>

### **Primitive Data Types & Objects** 
<br>

**Primitive data types are a set of basic data types in javascript.** <br><br>
 Object is a non primitive datatype in javascript. <br><br>
<p> <b>There are the 7 primitive datatypes in javascript</b></h2> <br>
1. Number <br>
2. Null <br>
3. String <br>
4.Symbol <br>
5.Undifined <br>
6.Boolean <br>
7.Big Int<br><br><br>

## **Objects**
An object in javascript can be created as follows- <br><br>
const item = {<br>
                name:"led"<br>
                price:"155"<br>
                             }
