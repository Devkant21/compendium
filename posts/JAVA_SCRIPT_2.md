## **Expression and Operators in Java Script**  
<br> 

## Expression in Java Script
<br>
A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression. Every value written literally is an expression. For eg. 77 or "Harry"

<br>

## Operators in Java Script
<br>

- **Arithmatic operator**
<br><br>
"+"  Addition <br>
"-"  Subtraction <br>
"/"  Division <br>
"*"  Multiplication <br>
"**" Exponential <br>
"%"  Modulus <br>
"++" Increment <br>
"--" Decrement <br>
<br><br>

- **Assignment operator**
<br><br>
"=" x=y
<br>
"+=" x=x+y
<br>
"-=" x=x-y
<br>
"/=" x=x/y
<br>
"%=" x=x%y
<br>
"*=" x=x*y
<br>
"**+" x=x**y
<br><br>

- **Comparision operators**
<br>
"==" Equal to 
<br>
"!=" Not equal
<br>
"===" equal value and type 
<br>
"!==" not equal or not equal type
<br>
">"  greater than 
<br>
"<" less than
 <br>
">=" greater than or equal to 
<br>
"<=" less than or equal to 
<br>
"?" ternary operator
<br><br>

- **Logical Operators**
<br>
"&&" logical AND
<br>
"||" logical OR
<br>
"!" logical NOT
<br>
Apart from these, we also have type and bitwise operators. Bitwise operators perform bit by bit operations on numbers. 
<br>
   eg.     7 + 8 = 15 
   <br> Here 7 and 8 is operands 
   <br> "+" is operator "15" is result
<br><br>

## Comments in Java Script
<br>

Sometiimes we want our programs to contain a text which is not executed by the JS engine. <br>
Such a text is called comment in Java Scrit. <br>
A comment in java script can be written as follows: <br>
let a=2; //this is a single line comment.
<br>
/*<br>
I am a <br>
muktiline comment<br>
*/ 
<br>
Sometimes comments are used to prevent the execution of some lines of code <br>
let switch = true;
<br>
// switch = false; ---- commented line wont execute.
